The corrected CSS code snippet addresses the unit inconsistency within the `calc()` function:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
  height: calc(50% - 5px); /*Corrected*/
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This version explicitly includes the `px` unit for the numerical values, ensuring consistent unit handling across different browsers and avoiding potential errors.  This ensures that the calculation is performed correctly and produces expected results.
