The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `calc()` function:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
  height: calc(50% - 5px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This code intends to set the width and height of an element dynamically based on its container. However, a potential issue arises if the `calc()` function attempts to subtract a unitless number from a percentage value.  Some browsers may handle this inconsistently, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors. The solution is to ensure consistent units within the `calc()` function.
